# goblin_camp
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/y2s82/goblin_camp.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/y2s82/goblin_camp)<br>
A git-based fork of [Goblin Camp](https://bitbucket.org/genericcontainer/goblin-camp), a [Dwarf-Fortress](http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/) clone.

This fork aims to investigate and identify possible performance bottleneck of the concept through exploring the Goblin Camp code.
One of the forseeable outcome is to introduce multithreading, but the project aims to explore other aspects of performance improvements as well.
